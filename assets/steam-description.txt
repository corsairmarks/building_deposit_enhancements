[h1]Changes[/h1]
Betharian Power Plants boost Technician output by base energy output by +2 and provide +4 generator district slots to the planet.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
As the title suggests, this mod overwrites the entry for the Betharian Power Plant ([b]building_betharian_power_plant[/b]). Also overridden is the Betharian Fields deposit [b]d_betharian_deposit[/b] - it is now slightly more likely to occur on dry planets.

Built for Stellaris version 3.8 "Gemini."  Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added or removed after the game has started. It only replaces default game objects, but may cause unemployment or negative generator districts when removed.  Back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod, even this one.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Overriding a building or deposit causes the game to log errors noting the overrides.  Expect to see two lines in the error.log file like these:
